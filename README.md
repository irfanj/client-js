Import.io JavaScript Client Library
=========

Use this client library to access [import.io](http://data.import.io) from client browsers.

To see how to use this library, view the sample in example.html.

All of the scripts are already hosted on our CDN for you to use. There is no need to host the JavaScript code yourself, and please don't link to the GitHub one!

To find out more about the library, visit [our docs](http://docs.import.io/guide/clientlibs.html#javascript)
